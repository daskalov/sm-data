Specifically, the goals are to introduce students to marketing strategy and to the elements of marketing analysis: customer analysis, competitor analysis, and company analysis; to familiarize students with the elements of the marketing mix (product strategy, pricing, advertising and promotion, and distribution), and to enhance problem solving and decision-making abilities in these operational areas of marketing; and to provide students with a forum (both written and verbal) for presenting and defending their own recommendations, and for critically examining and discussing the recommendations of others.</div>

					        	</h2>
					        	
									<div class="courseDescription">Marketing as both a discipline and in practice is much broader and more important than ever before in promoting products, services, and brands at the local and global levels. Since all Sloans are experienced managers who wish to enhance their organizational impact, understanding how to tell stories to further business objectives is a high level skill that is critical to their success (and to that of their organizations). The objective of this class is to provide you with perspectives on modern day marketing, and to teach you about the power of focused story telling as a call to action. As such, this 5-week course will be experiential and invites active participation by all students.  Course Content:  In preparation for this core class you will be assigned some reading to introduce you to core marketing principles; the first week of the class will be a review of the material. Questions to be explored include, What is the importance of marketing? How has marketing changed in the last few years? How do you define a marketing strategy?  Then we will do a four-week dive into a more experiential class built around the power of story in business. Guest speakers will share the power of the stories they have created at different parts of the life cycle, which we hope will inspire you to the importance of developing your own compelling stories.  You will be assigned to a 4-person group and decide what brand/project you want to work on. You will hone in on a single focused goal, figure out how to "reverse the rules" (i.e., tackle the single focused goal in a way that no one else has done, with a fresh approach) in order to grab attention, then tell a story.  At the end of the five weeks, we hope that we will have been successful in helping you better understand the new marketing landscape within our hyperconnected world, and how to leverage the power of technology so that you can be confident that your story has impact and meaning.</div>

									<div class="courseDescription">Our focus is on the question, "When launching a product, what are the framing issues that will help determine success?" In particular, we will provide you with tools to analyze market situations and determine whether it makes sense to launch a product or engage in a marketing-related investment. The course is not designed to cover issues such as execution of a strategy (although we will touch on this a bit), but on whether to enter a market to begin with. Thus, the course is decision oriented; we want you to think about market entry decisions and how you would make them. The tools that you will be provided won't consist of equations; instead, we'll arm you with a set of questions to ask, whose answers will help you make better decisions.  This course is an advanced applications marketing course. Unlike the base core course that is designed to cover every basic topic in marketing, here we focus on a number of basic questions and explore them in depth. Although we will have some lectures for background, the bulk of this endeavor will be accomplished through case discussions. In other words, we can't and won't cover everything, as this course is not designed to be comprehensive. We are going to rely on your academic background in marketing to cover the basics; here and there, it is possible that some material will be a review of what you've done before (there's nothing wrong with a little de ja vu). Unfortunately, due to the tight schedule we will not be able to cover any of the basics that are not already included in the course material.  The course includes, cases, lectures, and guest lectures.</div>

					        	</h2>
					        	
									<div class="courseDescription">We assume happiness is stable, an endpoint to achieve or goal to chase. It's not.  What we think drives our happiness often doesn't. So what does? And how can knowing this help us create strong companies and brands?  Understanding happiness is crucial to building successful relationships, products, and organizations. Yet recent research suggests that our definition of happiness is often confused and misguided. In this class, we explore new data on happiness, focusing on:  re-thinking happiness (a happy you)  designing happiness (a happy company)  spreading happiness (a happy brand)  Students will work together to use an iterative design-thinking approach to understand our own definitions of happiness, uncover what really makes us happy (vs. what we think makes us happy), prototype solutions/products to increase our happiness, and design happy companies and brands. The class will be data-driven, drawing on multiple methodologies both quantitative and ethnographic. Throughout the quarter, students will build a class-wide database to investigate real-world happiness data via an Designing Happiness app, and test hypotheses about what truly makes them, their teams and their customers happy. This class is recommended for students who plan to be a future entrepreneur building a strong brand, an employee who finds meaning in their work, or someone who wants to understand happiness.</div>

									<div class="courseDescription">Firms operate in an increasingly challenging business environment, with greater competition, more informed customers and rapidly changing market trends. Simultaneously, they also have access to more information about their customers, the marketplace and their competitors than ever before. In this environment, knowing how to use this information to make optimal business decisions is a crucial competitive advantage. Firms often have access to data that they do not know how to use. The objectives of this course are to introduce students to state-of-the-art marketing analytics and to teach them how to practically apply these analytics to real-world business decisions.  The following are examples of the types of questions that the course will address: How should a firm determine the prices for its products and services? What is the effect of television advertising on a brand's sales and how should advertising be optimized? What can a firm learn about its customers from online browsing behavior and how can this knowledge be used for targeted advertising and promotions? How should a firm allocate its sales force? How should a firm manage the allocation of its promotional budget in order to maximize its returns? How should the mailing of catalogs or direct mail be targeted to increase response rates?  The course will use a mix of lectures, cases, homework assignments and a course project to learn the material. Students do not need to have an advanced statistical background to take this course. Familiarity with the material in an introductory marketing course and an introductory statistics course will be assumed, but necessary material will be reviewed during the course of the quarter as necessary.</div>

									<div class="courseDescription">Contemporary approaches to marketing emphasize the importance of adopting a consumer focus, from determining consumers' wants and needs to shaping their attitudes and ensuring their loyalty.  This course provides insight into consumer psychology and the means by which consumer behavior can be influenced or altered. The course has both theoretical and practical objectives in that it will: (1) explore theory and research that is relevant to understanding consumer psychology and behavior, and (2) apply these theories and findings to generate ideas for developing effective marketing techniques and tactics. By shedding light on the psychological underpinnings of consumers' thoughts, attitudes, preferences, needs, and decision-making styles, this course will help students make more insightful and effective marketing decisions. Moreover, because this course takes a broad psychological perspective, it highlights novel ideas for grabbing attention, shaping behavior, and changing people's minds both within and outside of traditional marketing contexts.</div>

									<div class="courseDescription">This course will focus on empirical tools for analyzing dynamic decision contexts, wherein current actions of firms or consumers have effects on future payoffs, profits and/or competitive conduct. The course will build the relevant material generally, but our applications will be mostly focused on empirical marketing and industrial organization problems. We will have an applied focus overall, emphasizing the practical aspects of implementation, especially programming. The overall aim of the class is to help students obtain the skills to implement these methods in their research. By the end of the class, students are expected to be able to formulate a dynamic decision problem, program it in a language such as Matlab or C, and to estimate the model from data. The course starts with an overview of consumer theory and static models of consumer choice. We build on this material and introduce discrete choice markovian decision problems, and continuous markovian decision problems, and focus on building the computational toolkit for the numerical analysis of these problems. We then move on to specific applications, and discuss multi-agent dynamic equilibrium models. Finally, we discuss recently proposed advanced methods for alleviating computational burden in dynamic models.</div>
